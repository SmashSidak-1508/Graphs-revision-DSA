Striver graph Series

In data structures, a graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of a collection of nodes (or vertices) connected by edges. Graphs are used to model a wide range of real-world relationships and systems, making them a fundamental data structure in computer science and mathematics.

Here are some key components and concepts associated with graphs:

1. **Vertex (Node):** A vertex is a fundamental unit in a graph, often representing an entity or an element. Each vertex can have a unique identifier or label.

2. **Edge:** An edge is a connection or relationship between two vertices. Edges may be directed (with a specific direction from one vertex to another) or undirected (bidirectional).

3. **Directed Graph (Digraph):** In a directed graph, edges have a direction, meaning they go from one vertex to another. This direction can be thought of as an arrow indicating a one-way relationship.

4. **Undirected Graph:** In an undirected graph, edges have no direction, and the relationship between vertices is bidirectional.

5. **Weighted Graph:** Some graphs assign weights or values to their edges, indicating the strength, distance, cost, or some other measure of the relationship between vertices.

6. **Adjacency:** Two vertices are said to be adjacent if there is an edge connecting them. The set of all adjacent vertices to a given vertex forms its adjacency list.

7. **Path:** A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices where each adjacent pair is connected by an edge. A path can be a simple path (no repeated vertices) or a cycle (a path that starts and ends at the same vertex).

8. **Connected Graph:** A graph is connected if there is a path between any two vertices in the graph. Otherwise, it is disconnected.

9. **Acyclic Graph:** A graph is acyclic if it has no cycles (i.e., no closed paths). A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a directed graph with no cycles.

Graphs are used to model various real-world scenarios, including social networks, transportation networks, computer networks, recommendation systems, and more. They are also used in solving problems and algorithms like graph traversal (e.g., BFS and DFS), shortest path algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm), and network flow algorithms.

Graphs offer a versatile and powerful way to represent and analyze complex relationships and structures in many domains of computer science and beyond.
